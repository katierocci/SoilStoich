Code for figures in manuscript aligning soil C:N in empiricism and theory with process-based terrestrial biogeochemistry models

MIMICS-CN_base_sensitivity creates figures 3 (MIMICS sensitvity to litter quality) and 5 (SOM fraction, soil texture, and SOM C:N comparison)

MIMICS-CN_base_ftn creates figures 4 (biotic case study) and 6 (elevated carbon dioxie experiment)

Other files are needed to run code in above R files
